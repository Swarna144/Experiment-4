EXPERIMENT 4

Aim:
To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators.

Theory:
In C++, operators are special symbols that perform operations on operands. They are categorized into various types based on their functionality:

Bitwise Operators: Operate on bits and perform bit-level operations.
• & → Bitwise AND
• | → Bitwise OR
• ^ → Bitwise XOR
• ~ → Bitwise NOT
• << → Left shift
• >> → Right shift

CONCLUSION- we learned how to use Bitwise operators in C++.
